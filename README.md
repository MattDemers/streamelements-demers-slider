# Matt Demers' Simple Slider Widget for StreamElements

I was annoyed at StreamElements' default "Row" widget, so I decided to make my own.

## Instructions for Install:

1. Enable custom CSS for your widget.
2. Add the contents of "demers-slider.css" to the CSS tab
3. Add the contents of "demers-slider.html" to the HTML tab
4. Add the contents of "demers-slider.json" to the Fields tab

## Instructions for Customization

**Important Note**: You **must** use the pickers in the "Variables" menu, **not** the default StreamElements pickers. These will not work.
