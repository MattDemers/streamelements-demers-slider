# Matt Demers' Simple Slider Widget for StreamElements

I was annoyed at StreamElements' default "Row" widget, so I decided to make my own.

## Instructions:

1. Enable custom CSS for your widget.
2. Add the contents of "demers-slider.css" to the CSS tab
3. Add the contents of "demers-slider.html" to the HTML tab
4. Add the contents of "demers-slider.js" to the JS tab (I didn't change much in here that would affect the widget, but I figured I'd keep it just in case something broke)

## How to add images

I don't know how to implement StreamElements' UI picker (for now), so here's how I added images.

* Upload images to Imgur.com and use that direct URL in the .html code (see the code itself for instructions)
* Upload an image to StreamElements and "choose" it, then right-click the image and hit "copy **image** URL"
