# Matt Demers' Simple Slider Widget for StreamElements

I was annoyed at StreamElements' default "Row" widget, so I decided to make my own.

## Instructions for Install:

1. Enable custom CSS for your widget.
2. Add the contents of "demers-slider.css" to the CSS tab
3. Add the contents of "demers-slider.html" to the HTML tab
4. Add the contents of "demers-slider.json" to the Fields tab

## Instructions for Customization

**Important Note**: You **must** use the pickers and text field in the "Variables" menu, **not** the default StreamElements pickers. These will not work.

### Images

Under "variables" there's an image picker

### Highlight color

Under "variables" there's a color picker

### Font

Under "variables" there's a Google Font picker

### Message

In the "variables", you can change your message for the alert. You can put in StreamElements' variables. If you want to add the Highlight color around anything, surround the word(s) with `<span class="highlight">TEXT</span>`.

## How to find StreamElements' variables

Usually in the alert you're editing, it'll show the valid variables at the top.
